  WP URL Migrator v0.1.1

  This is a simpe URL replace script to be used in Wordpress.

  To use, run into the command line or shell.
  
  Sample usage is:
  
  $ php ./wp_url_migrator.php h=localhost u=root p= d=bizlist x=bizlist_ http://192.168.1.1 http://localhost

  where:
  h => the database server host
  u => database user to use
  p => password of the database user, write 'p=' without quote if none
  d => the database name
  x => the table prefix, write 'x=' without quote if none

  The last two arguments stand for pattern and replacement, and they should be the last ones in the line.

  Remember to back up your database before running this script. I am not held liable for any circumstances
  as a result of using this script. Good luck to your migratrion!
